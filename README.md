# rubiks-cube

in this repo i will publish my bachelors diploma thesis, which was an in depth analysis of the DeepCubeA algorithm (F. Agostinelli) to solve the rubiks cube using deep reinforcement learning

since we're talking about deep learning, here is a picture of a 
**fish from the deep sea which can walk!**
